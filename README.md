# EWS Contact Sync
Utilizes both Exchange Web Services and Office 365 Remote PowerShell Services to sync your Global Address List to any/every user in the directory.

**Why would I want to use this?** iPhone/Android devices don't currently support offline Global Address List synchronization. By loading the Global Address List contacts into a folder within user's mailbox, you can circumvent this limitation.

**Features**
- Fetch a list of contacts using the Office 365 Directory
- Import the list of contacts into a specified user's Office 365 mailbox
- You can run the sync for any number of users
- Specify a custom contact folder
- Uses Application Impersonation so this can all be done from a single admin account (that has Application Impersonation permissions)

## Getting Started

1. Install the EWS API here: https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=42951
2. Download the latest version of the script here: https://github.com/grahamr975/EWS-Office365-Contact-Sync
3. Export your Office 365 administrator credentials to a CliXml credential file. See below for an example on how to do this.
```
$Credxmlpath = "C:\MyCredentials\"
$Credential | Export-Clixml $Credxmlpath
```
4. You may need to unblock the included .dll files. To do this, navigate to EWSContacts\Module\bin -> For each .dll file, right click on the file -> Check 'Unblock'

4. To test the script, run for a single mailbox in your directory. See below for an example (batch file)
```
@echo off
cd "%~dp0EWS-Office365-Contact-Sync"

PowerShell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass ^
-File "%CD%\EWSContactSync.ps1" ^
-CredentialPath "C:\Encrypted Credentials\SecureCredential.cred" ^
-FolderName "Directory Contacts" ^
-LogPath "%~dp0Logs" ^
-MailboxList john.doe@mycompany.com ^
-ModernAuth
pause
```
5. Once you're ready, specify DIRECTORY for MailboxList. This will sync the contacts for all users in your directory. See below for an example (batch file)
```
@echo off
cd "%~dp0EWS-Office365-Contact-Sync"

PowerShell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass ^
-File "%CD%\EWSContactSync.ps1" ^
-CredentialPath "C:\Encrypted Credentials\SecureCredential.cred" ^
-FolderName "Directory Contacts" ^
-LogPath "%~dp0Logs" ^
-MailboxList DIRECTORY ^
-ModernAuth
pause
```

### Prerequisites

- EWS API 2.2 https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=42951
- O365 Global Admin Account with **Application Impersonation permissions** (You MUST set this seperately)
- Verify the neccessary Office 365 URLs are whitelisted in your environment. All Microsoft 365 Common URLs with ID#56 on the following page should be allowed: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/enterprise/urls-and-ip-address-ranges?view=o365-worldwide
- Powershell Version 3.0+
- Think of a unique folder name (Any contacts not in the Global Address List will be deleted from the folder, so don't use 'Contacts' as the name.)
